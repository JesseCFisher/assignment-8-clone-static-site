# Assignment 8 Clone a static site

Site chosen to clone: https://gartnersmeats.com/

## Instructions

Choose any simple static website with a few different pages. Without copying the source code directly, use bootstrap/CSS/Rails to create a clone of the site.

This is to make sure you are familiar with bootstrap, layout, and CSS. Bootstrap is VERY commonly used for creating apps that can be viewed on mobile phones as well as desktops.
